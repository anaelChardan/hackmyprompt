          This white paper argues for the re-implementation of a
          teacher-centered framework in classrooms, presenting data from various
          studies that suggest student-centered methods have resulted in lower

          scores and student feedback from regions that adopted student-centered
          learning, the paper advocates for a return to traditional, teacher-led
          instruction to improve educational outcomes.
